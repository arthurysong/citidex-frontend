# Citidex 

## Description

CMS SPA built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. 

After watching a bunch of Graham Stephen videos, I was looking into homes and locations to buy my first rental property. I built this application to help me catalog all the homes and cities I looked into during my home search.

[Deployed using Heroku](https://citidex.herokuapp.com/)

[API used](https://github.com/arthurysong/real-estate-app)
